== description
This project is storing my solutions against the problems in Project Euler. I tried to not only solve solutions, but learn about CI/CD concept as follows.

* Structure
** Project, directory, data and so on
* Testing
* Collaboration with external services
** Travis

This is why sometimes my code has some lengthy in spite of easy solutions.

== Target language
